Snappy
======

Simulator device independent snapshot testing, build on [FBSnapshotTestCase](https://github.com/facebook/ios-snapshot-test-case).

Why?
----

Snapshot testing helps to deliver views that scale correctly with a wide range of screen sizes. When it comes to view controllers, we usually want to ensure they keep visual quality on a various set of existing devices, in each supported orientation. Test suite could be run on numerous variants of iOS Simulators. However, this could be a really time-consuming task, for sure not acceptable during a development process. Snappy tackles this issue by combining test with a set of Device definitions (including screen size, scale factor, and orientation) to validate with, ignoring real device simulator context information.

Quick Start
-----------

Validating view controller on all existing iPhones, with portrait orientation (default):

```
#!swift

func testAllDevices() {
    let window = UIWindow()
    window.makeKeyAndVisible()
    window.rootViewController = ExampleViewController(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)
    verifyViewSnaps(DeviceRack.iPhone.all, view: window)
}
```

Defining device set cheat sheet
-------------------------------
* `DeviceRack.iPhone.all.landscape` - all iPhones in landscape orientation
* `DeviceRack.iPhone.all.protrait.uniqueWidths` - set of iPhones covering all possible screen width in portrait orientation
* `DeviceRack.iPad.retina` - retina 9.7" / 7.9" inch iPad

Installation using CocoaPods
----------------------------

Add following line to your test target pods list in `Podfile`:

`pod 'Snappy'`
